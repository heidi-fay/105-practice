                <h4>EVERYTHING WILL BE GARBAGE FOR A WHILE AND THAT'S OKAY.</h4>
                <p>You are learning SEVERAL new languages BY YOURSELF which were basically INVENTED in the last hundred years and constantly evolve. Nobody hands you a newsletter when something changes in tech, you just have to keep up.</p>

                <p>The only thing that matters is movement. Keep going. One lesson, half a lesson, anything. Read an article, google a concept you're unclear on. If you start hating one part of it, take a break and learn something else- brush up on photoshop. The knowledge to be gained is endless.</p>

                <h4>And that's where things get hard.</h4>
                <p>There is <b>so much</b> to learn. It can get overwhelming really fast. I'm hyperventilating just thinking about it. So don't.</p>

                <p>This isn't a race. Learn it, retain it, enjoy it. And forget some of it. Cause that's what people do. That's what all these freaking bookmarks are for dude.</p>
